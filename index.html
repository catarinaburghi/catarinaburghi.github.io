The "greeting" section is a container which has its contents centered in the browser

The following styles are applied:
- text-align: center
--- This centers the contents of the container horizontally
- margin: auto
--- This centers the contents of the container horizontally as well (a backup)
- margin-top
--- This is a way to fake a vertical center. Tweak this as needed
- max-width
--- This stops the content from looking weird on a big screen
