Hi! I’m Catarina. I’m a high school student in Ontario that participates in the First Robotics Competitions (with team 5024 Raider Robotics). The purpose that I choose for this website is to share my experiences as a programmer in the Robotics competitions and to share personal experiences about other things as well.
