I don't know how to do this, and that's where it all started.
So I am a member of my school's [FRC](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) team, [5024 Raider Robotics](https://www.raiderrobotics.org/) and I decided to join because I love STEM related things and I decided that it would be a great idea to join the Robotics team.

At first I wasn't planning on becoming a programmer. I was planning on being part of the build team, if I went through with being on the build team I wouldn't be writting this. 

So my father is also works with programming related things and he told me to at least give programming a shot, he told me it would be easier for me to do programming than doing build related related things. So I talked with one of the mentors on the team and he told me to give it a shot (and looking back at that time I think I made the right choice).

So I gave it a shot, and on the first few weeks I felt a little bit left out. I am the only girl in the programming subteam and sometimes I felt like I didn't belong there just because:

 1. Most of the time I was just watching the older members do the work
 2. Some people told me I should have picked something like build or media (which I wasn't mostly interrested in)
 3. Sometimes when I piched in my ideas people wouldn't take me seriously.

But as the season went on I started learning more, and more about programming and about what FRC actually is. And I made some good friends too. 

You are probably very curious of what I mean by "Close encounters with high speed Robots", it's a fun story. But first I'll give you some background information:

This year's "game" for FRC was [Infinite Recharge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmiYWTmFRVE).

Our Robot [Death Raider](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/5024), is a robot that has a few powerful subsystems, like our Intake, Hopper, Shooter, Climber, Drivetrain, and our beloved Vision Target.

On a Friday night me and another one of the programmers were testing our Vision Target, the point of having that vision target is that we can get the robot to line up on a position by it's self to shoot the balls into the goal.

 We were testing that in our build room. Our build room has very bright lights and instead of the target the vision target tracked one of the lights and came back full speed at me and my friend. He managed to get out of the way but I got lucky enough to get trapped between a desk and a pile of scrap metal (It wasn't a fun night).
