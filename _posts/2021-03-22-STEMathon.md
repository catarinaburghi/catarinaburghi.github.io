[The Girls and Allies in FIRST STEMathon](https://www.firstroboticscanada.org/stemathon/register/)
## Thursday night:

On thursday night, they had a social game night where I got to meet other people who were participating in the STEMathon.
There were games like Codenames, Among us and a few other fun games.

## Saturday:

At 10 am on Saturday morning the [live stream](https://www.twitch.tv/firstcanada) started with a brief introduction. Then there were a few panels and presentations that were useful for me when working on the STEMathon. I was taking notes which I used later in the day.

Then the theme was revealed and this years STEMathon theme is LIMITLESS Accessibility! So me and my team worked together for over 12 hours to come up with a problem that people face in the world and a solution for it, our "problem" was People with disabilities and swimming. We brainstormed throughout the day and we came up with H2O Float! It's a bracelet that people with disabilities can wear and it helps them not drown when they go swimming! 

How it works: The bracelet hast a heart monitor sensor that monitors the heartbeat of the person wearing it, when there is a spike in the heart rate (Ex. You go from 80 bpm to 100 bpm in less than 1 second) or when it slows down too fast (Ex. You go from 80 bpm to 60 bpm), the bracelet beeps very loudly so people around the person wearing it can find them quickly, it also deploys a floaty, which brings the person wearing the bracelet to the surface.

We did a lot of research on how to make it cheap so many people can have access to it! Here is a picture of the CAD I made for it with the help of my best friend.

I also wrote some programs for this:

One of them asks the user to input the number of kids with ASD, and it outputs how many of them would drown. The statistics of it are very morbid. 9 out 10 kids with ASD under the age of 14 die due to drowning. 

The other program that I wrote is basically showing how I would program the monitor to let the alarm and the floatie know when to deploy and play, the commented part is how I would want it to be programmed but that would require a little bit more work and I unfortunally wouldn't have time to finish it for the presentations on Sunday.

(But one of the mentors offered to help me out with the API for it after the STEMathon so maybe I'll be able to do it one day)

## Sunday:

I went to sleep at 3 in the morning on the Sunday, and got up at 5 am. It was worth it though. I went straight to work. Everything was due at 7 am, we managed to get all the files handed in (CAD, code, slides, and the infographic). 

After that at 8:30 am they started the judging rounds, every team had 10 minutes with the judges, 30 seconds for the mentor to introduce you, 5 minutes of the presentation, and 3 or so minutes for the judges to ask questions and for us to answer them. 

After we did that, they were doing a few games and playing Kahoot for the teams that were either waiting to be called in for the judging round or if you were done and waiting for the call back results.

After the call back rounds, all we had to do was wait until 4pm when they would start the award shows, I was very excited about it because we had made it to the finals.
 
When they announced the awards I was very excited to see if I won any FIRST Canada swag, which my team won by winning the most active slack channel award, which is pretty funny that they had it. But for the big award that my team won was the Best Product award. 

I was super excited about it! The teams that won the Best Product award, Best Pitch and the Overall Winners award, were called to join a meeting right after the winners were announced. 

In the meeting we were told that they wanted us to present our Projects and Business Ideas on a live stream on Twitch on the same night of the FRC District awards. We were all very excited about it.


## Monday:

On the Monday we had a Tech rehearsal were we talked about if we had any examples (In my case code), that we should make a video showing it and adding it to the slides with our presentation in the spots where we would usually talk about them.

Everything went smoothly in the meeting and I just had to record my code being used so I could add it to the slides for the presentation.

## Tuesday:

Tuesday was a big day, I went to school in the morning and was chatting with my friend about my weekend, I told her I was going to present the project with my team and she was super excited to watch me present. I had a few friends and a couple of people in my family that wanted to watch me present the project with my team.

I did the recordings for my programs, and added them to the slides when I got home. 

When it was around 5:30 I started getting ready for the presentation, I had to be in a call at 6:15 to do sound check. My team and I decided to go with Business Casual attire. I had picked out a nice blazer from my closet and a black top. I was very excited for the presentation, and was a bit nervous. But I did chat with some of my friends before the show so I was a bit better.

## The presentation: 

Live on [FIRST Canada's twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/firstcanada) my presentation was the first one up after they introduced and talked about the STEMathon. I was super excited and I was ready. We had practiced multiple times and we had the scripts with us so nothing could go wrong right? Well, the only thing that went wrong was one of the videos displaying my code. It was quiet for a couple of seconds and then I realised it wasn't going to work, so I explain the code as best I could and we moved on with the presentation. 

The next slide showed the beautiful CAD model of the bracelet, I explained what would need to happen to activate the bracelet and the next slide was another video of my code simmulating the conditions that the bracelet would activate it's systems. That video worked and because I don't talk in that part if the video hadn't worked I wouldn't be able to explain the code. But it worked out in the end and I was super happy about it. The rest of the presentation went great and we finished quite quickly.

Overall I had a great weekend, I made new friends, solved a big and important problem and won a good award for it! I 100% recommend doing the STEMathon next year, I know I definitely will sign up for it!
