I decided to learn a little bit of Blender a couple months back, I started out with this wonderful Toyota Supra.

It is one of my favorite cars and I thought it might be cool to play around with it a little bit. 

The CAD model for the Supra isn't mine I got it from [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2870122/files) I did make the spoiler, I removed the original spoiler that was on the car and decided to make another one for it.

I do have more Blender projects that I'm working on like for example a formula 1 car that I'm currently designing.
