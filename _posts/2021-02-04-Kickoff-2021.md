For this year's [FRC](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) game, there are a bunch of different challenges that we can participate in:


The Infinite Recharge at Home Challenge:
In this challenge we have a few different events that we can participate in:
The Galatic Search Challenge
The AutoNav Challenge
The Hyperdrive Challenge
The Interestellar Accuracy Challenge
The Power Port Challenge


The Game Design Challenge:
In this challenge we have to come up with a cool game to play with the robots, and if they like the idea of your game they might use it in a future game!


The FIRST Innovation Challenge presented by Qualcomm:
In this challenge we have to identify a problem and design a solution to help people keep, regain, or achieve optimum physical and/or mental health and fitness through active play or movement.


All of these Challenges were presented to us on a live stream on [Twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/firstinspires) on the 9th of January 2021. 

I personally think these challenges are a great way to stay involved with robotics even at home, even though there won't be any competitions that we can go to, we will still have a lot of fun doing this challenges.
